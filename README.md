Designing networks, configuring switches with precision,  
Laying fiber, wires, no room for derision,  
Spider webs ain't what we envision,  
We acquire knowledge through documentation, our mission.

Next up, we check everything's in place,  
Internet's missed? Don't worry, it's not a race,  
You're lucky, my friend, a smile on your face,  
Sit at your computer, let's dive into cyberspace.

Open Elastic, fire up your Asterisk brain,  
VoIP reborn, it's time to entertain,  
Conference rooms, call recording, dial plan reign,  
Our daily work's done, celebrate the gain!
