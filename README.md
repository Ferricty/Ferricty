# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Telecommunication Engineer with a deep love by programming and maths. I specialize in delivering practical solutions to real-world problems. With a focus on data science, I have developed a wide range of projects, including:

- Developing backends with Django and template systems using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootsrap for web applications.
- Designing and creating graphical interfaces with Python's Tkinter library that enable efficient analysis of large volumes of data, significantly reducing the time required for manual tasks to mere seconds.
- Utilizing matplotlib, seaborn and plotly to create insightful data visualizations and constructing dashboards in Excel or using streamlit.

I believe that continuous learning and teaching are essential to personal and professional growth, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques. As a dedicated and motivated individual, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team and tackle challenging problems to drive business success.
