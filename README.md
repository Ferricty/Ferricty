Configure switches with precision,  
Lay fiber, wires, no derision.  
Envision a web, no spider's mission,  
Wisdom gained through documentation.

Check all's in place, no need to haste,  
Internet missed? Not a race.  
Lucky you, a smile on your face,  
Sit, dive into cyberspace, embrace.

Open Elastic, fire Asterisk, entertain,  
VoIP reborn, it's time to gain.  
Conference, record, dial plan reign,  
Work's done, celebrate the gain!
